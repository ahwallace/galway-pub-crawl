# Galway Pub Cawl

Using Google's OR-Tools for Simulated Annealing (SA) and NetworkX/OSMNX for finding shortest paths (Dijkstra's algorithm) between nodes (pubs) in a graph (street network). Gradio provides a simple UI for choosing which pub locations to visit.

The goal is to optimise the route distance between a set of chosen pubs in Galway. Useful for those on a pub crawl wanting to find the shortest route between their favourite pubs.
